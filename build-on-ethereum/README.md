In this quest, we will build on previous quest and integrate Compound to get a real interest rate.

## Bank for all cryptocurrencies
In this quest, we will modify previous quest to support all crypto currencies.

## Launching your own coin
In this quest, we will create and launch our coin a.k.a. as cryptocurrency.

## Incentivize people to own your coins
This quest will lay the foundation for what is called cryptoeconomics. Cryptoeconomics is where the application drives desired behaviour by means of financial incentives.
